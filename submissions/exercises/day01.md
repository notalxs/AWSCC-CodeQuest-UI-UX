<h2 align=center> ðŸš€ UI and UX analyses for Day 1 ðŸš€</h2> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

- <b>Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer:</b> Personally, I find Shopee easier to navigate and operate since I have been using it ever since I started online shopping.

- <b>Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer:</b> In both shopping sites, I would consider the pop-up advertisements as distractions, especially those that contain false exit buttons to redirect users to another link. For Lazada, I find its categories section confusing since the items in this area are more randomly categorized compared to Shopeeâ€™s way of grouping its products. Another would be the alignment of media elements in Lazadaâ€™s platform, which varies on the provided product pictures, unlike in Shopee which is equally aligned to the product alongside it.

- <b>Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer:</b> I think both platforms are still easy to scan and understand, but once again, I prefer Shopee for content alignment and organization as I find it clearer to understand both visually and in writing. 

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   <b>Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer:</b> I believe both websitesâ€™ layouts and designs are almost similar, only varying in color, amount of text, and element organization. I do think it is consistent with their brandâ€™s purpose and attractive to the eye, although sometimes it can appear to be too overcrowded for me that I refuse to use it for a while.
    
-   <b>Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer:</b> All clickable elements in both websites have fast responsiveness and navigate to their corresponding contents. 
    
-   <b>Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer:</b> In my opinion, I think Shopeeâ€™s overall visual aspect is better than Lazadaâ€™s.
